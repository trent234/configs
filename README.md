# configs/scripts
config hub useful for getting personalization & workflow asap on new systems   

### list of configs and purpose
xorg -> the x11 server configuration needed to start my wm of choice and statusbar and set initial configs.   
dwm -> my window manager  
goblocks -> my window manager status bar  
zsh -> my shell  
nvim -> my text editor  
clipmenu -> configs to converge clipboards throughout the system and make it usable and convenient.  
(TODO: fix clipmenu bugs. needs occasional restarts).    
scrot -> little wrapper script calling scrot (short for SCReenshOT) and placing it in the appropriate dir.  
### screenshot
it doesn't show about 95% of the functionality that these configs/scripts allow  
but here is what the the typical window looks like.
