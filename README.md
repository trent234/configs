# configs/scripts
config hub useful for getting personalization & workflow asap on new arch installs

### list of configs and purpose
* xorg -> the x11 server configuration needed to start my wm of choice and statusbar and set initial configs.   
* dwm -> my window manager  
* goblocks -> my window manager status bar  
* grub -> boot manager  
* zsh -> my shell  
* st -> my terminal emulator (launches a vim terminal emulator)
* nvim -> my text editor  
* clipmenu -> configs to converge clipboards throughout the system and make it usable and convenient.  
* misc_scripts are one-offs that don't deserve a folder, but they are useful shortcuts  

#### TODO:  
* fix clipmenu bugs. needs occasional restarts.  
* fix udev monitor swap. not done with that.  
* would be great to fix fonts. all emoji from one, all others from another, and also include patched powerline fonts so all vim-airline characters render. 


### screenshot
it doesn't show about 95% of the functionality that these configs/scripts allow  
but here is what the the typical window looks like.
