# configs/scripts
config hub useful for getting personalization & workflow asap on new systems   

### list of configs and purpose
xorg -> the x11 server configuration needed to start my wm of choice and statusbar and theme it  
dwm -> my window manager  
dwmstatus -> my window manager status bar  
zsh -> my shell  
nvim -> my text editor  
clipmenu -> configs to converge clipboards throughout the system and make it usable and convenient.  

### screenshot
