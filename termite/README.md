DESCRIPTION:   
termite is my new terminal replacing urxvt. still have to see all the features  
and especially what vim like actions are because of zsh and what are builtin  
because thats a feature. for now, zsh addons have not changed to accomodate termite.  
mainly switched for fun and because i've heard about its neat features for a while  
and its lightweight and it accomodates emojis ðŸ˜Š. 

COREQUISITE:  
* none really but technically X11 (dwm)
